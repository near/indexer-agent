 * #### Interface for Capturing Data About an Event in `handleStreamerMessage()`
 *
 * The interface to capture data about an event has the following arguments:
 *  - `standard`: name of standard, e.g. nep171
 *  - `version`: e.g. 1.0.0
 *  - `event`: type of the event, e.g. `nft_mint`
 *  - `data`: associate event data. Strictly typed for each set {standard, version, event} inside corresponding NEP
